As I'm sitting there I see the entire dev team go into another restaurant across the street.\n\nWednesday, the VP tells me we do \"lunch and learn.\"  They order food and someone will give a lecture on a CS topic.  There was a signup list for a carryout place.  I sign up.  At noon I go the conference room.  The delivery guys passes out the lunches.  No lunch for Ch3t.  He pulls out the signup list.

{"body": "I think it seems like gender is, originally speaking, a noun. \"Masculine\" and \"feminine\" are examples of genders in the linguistic sense--these are adjectives--and used to described people in recent years, \"male\" and \"female\" are examples.\n\nEnglish frequently verbs nouns (like I just did with verb): land a plane, pencil you in, google it. To assign a gender to something is therefore to gender it. A word in a language that has gendered words could be masculine or feminine or neuter (ungendered).\n\nJust speaking the language, it seems like it would make more sense to use a past participle form, because gender seems like it would be a verb. It simply looks better and sounds better.\n\nBut when you look at the point of describing the identity, of course, that makes it sound like there was some changes to gender that happened at a point in the past.
